"""
Event based callbacks.

Multiple threads/processes may `notify` events,
and each `register`ed callback will receive a copy of the event.
Registered callbacks will persist across forks,
but will not be synchronized afterwards â€”
child may register additional callbacks,
but they will not be observable in parent, and vice versa.

Each process interested in executing callbacks should call `callback_loop`,
and registered callbacks will execute in each of such processes.

Event data passed to `notify` must be pickleable.
If IPC is enabled, events will be sent between processes using the CALLBACK group.
